	PRESENTATION NOTES, DO WITH THIS WHAT YOU WILL

	We decided to use Ionic with Vue for our app. The main reason for using the Ionic Framework is because it suits our needs perfectly;
	It offers some very unique functionality that is priceless when approaching development from a progressive webapp
	perspective. For example, Capacitor (a part of the Ionic framework)
	is a cross-platform native runtime that makes it easy to build modern web apps that run natively on iOS, Android, and the Web.
	We can mostly obviously demonstrate the usefulness of this tool via the 2nd tab view, photos. Here you see, after clicking this partially
	hidden blue button just above the bottom tab header, is an interface that 
	exposes the API of Capacitor Camera (as well as the filesystem API, behind the scenes). Depending on the OS currently being run on,
	Capacitor will automatically interact with the native functionality of each OS. So simply by utilizng up this complex algorithm
	for our webapp, we can rest easy knowning that most of the work involved with porting to mobile platforms is taken care of for us.
	This is trumendously useful given the scope of our project. This leaves us more time to sort out design, our own upcoming sorting 
	algorithms, and perhaps most substantially learning Ionic and Vue frameworks themselves alongside the hundreds of interconnected
	dependencies that Ionic is built upon.
